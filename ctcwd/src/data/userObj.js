        App Academy's full-stack bootcamp in 2022, I spent a year as a teaching assistant, honing my skills and helping 
        others learn. This experience led me to a role as a consultant developer at Thoughtworks, where I further expanded my expertise in the field.
        Currently, I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree while also working as a freelance developer, creating beautiful 
        websites for clients. I'm always excited about new opportunities to collaborate and create innovative solutions.
