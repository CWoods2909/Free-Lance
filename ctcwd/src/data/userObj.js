        App Academy's full-stack bootcamp in 2022, I spent a year as a teaching assistant, honing my skills and helping 
        others learn. This experience led me to a role as a consultant developer at Thoughtworks, where I further expanded my expertise in the field.
        Currently, I'm pursuing my bachelor's degree while also working as a freelance developer, creating beautiful 
        websites for clients. I'm excited to see what we can create together!`,

        board-certified music therapist before falling in love with coding. This blend of experiences has taught me 
        that technology, like music, has incredible power to help people thrive. I've had the joy of creating donor 
        engagement solutions for nonprofits and working with amazing clients at Thoughtworks to turn their ideas into 
        reality. Whether you're looking to innovate or solve complex challenges, I'd love to connect and help make
